# Problems vs. Algorithms

There is no broken or not passing test. Every test for every problem passes.

## Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

Note: I use -∞ and +∞ to compare with. In a case of empty input default (-∞, +∞) will be returned. 

Time complexity: O(n). I iterate over an input array only once.  
Space complexity: O(1). There are only auxiliary elements in the function.
